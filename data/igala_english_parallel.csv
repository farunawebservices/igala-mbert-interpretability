"Ama ejo le̩ ka ñw onobule̩ kakini, I chʼeku me̩ aku n.","And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
"Todu O̩jo̩ chema ka kʼo̩jo̩ ku me̩ je̩ e-le̩ e̩gbale̩ tak eju-me̩ ane̩, taku me̩ adab O̩jo̩, me̩ ama e̩nyo̩ kpai e̩bie̩ne̩.","The name of the first

is Hiddekel: that
is
 it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river
is Euphrates."
"Taku Jihofa O̩jo̩ nomudala do̩ one̩, i la ka ñw u kakini, Ugbo e̩ de̩?","And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
"Oñ i kakini, U gbʼiche̩-we̩ ef uche̩, oñ u railo, todabu kʼu tago ofo; tak u dʼo̩lami maja-i.","And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"

"Tak one̩ kakini, Onobule̩ kʼe̩ duwa kʼi dʼugbo mi, owñ mʼe̩ro oli le̩ du ñw mi, oñ u mʼu du je̩.","And the LORD God said,
It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."
"Taku Jihofa O̩jo̩ ka ñw onobule̩ le̩ kakini, E̩wñ chʼe-kʼuwe̩ che-i? Tak onobule̩ le̩ kakini, Ejo le̩ gba mi ibe, tak u je̩.","And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
was the name thereof."
"Taku Jihofa O̩jo̩ ka ñw ejo kakini,

And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
"Taki Ken ka ñwu Jihofa kakini, Udu kʼe̩ bu mi-i i nana tʼumi le.","And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"

was good for food, and that it
was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."
"Ma la bi Irad ñw Ino̩k; Irad la bi Me̩hujae̩l, Me̩hujae̩l la bi Me̩tushae̩l, Me̩tushae̩l la bi Lame̩k.","And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
